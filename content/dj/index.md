###Still Amateur 7 Feb. 2012
From Minimal to D'n'B

40 minutes of 9 New House Tracks from the end of December 2011 with Minimal Ambient Grooves at the beginning. In the middle enjoy mainstream remakes like Bob's One Love and surprise: If you remember the Metroid Game on the NES you will love that last Drum'n'Bass song from Excision & Datsik called Deviance.
DISCLAIMER: I had some problems at the middle of the session to put the beats together, but I didn't want to delete it, so enjoy!


###Still Amateur 15 Feb. 2012
From Disco to Techno Pop

This 16 tracks session put together in a 50 minutes session was more complicated to mix. Begins with at 114 BPM Classic Funky track called Forget Me Notes from Patrice Rushen. The next song dates from 1982: I'm your Boogie Man from the 70's KC And The Sunshine Band. Then the session continues with Chill Out from Jazzanova and Ian Pooley. Before entering to House I mixed Billie Jean from Michael Jackson. At the end of the session you will enjoy old Robert Miles - Children from the 90's and Golden Dreams from Invisible Limits, a real Techno Pop Classic at 140 BPM!
Like in the previous session, this is Still Amateur! Disfruta!
