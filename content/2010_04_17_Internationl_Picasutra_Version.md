When the iPad will be launched internationally we will also launch our localized Picasutra Version for the iPhone + iPad. Until then our app will be available with a real price off!

## Update: 15/08/2010

We are working hard to put out the new International Picasutra version that will include:

    Touch Events.
    French translation (Thank’s to Mark S.)
    Spanish translation (Thank’s to Ely and his friends Pikos and Lokotron).
