I would like to thank to the following people and institutions that contributed that our project is now reality:

    First of all I would like to thank my parents for their support, I appreciate a lot to not going nuts when I told them I would program a Kamasutra.
    Pikatxu for doing so nice Graphics! Without her help this would be a old fashioned way Kamasutra!
    Evil Ely and her friends Mr. Pikos and Lokotron for writing the original text's. Without them the originality of this work would not be possible in this short time.
    I would like to thank my friends Mayte and Dani for their early support last year for not giving up in learning to write iPhone Code .
    Carlos for tips related to doing projects.
    Kim for his marketing tips.
