Today my partner and I decided to create Pica Creations. It was on this day, Monday the first February of 2010 that I told her that I have a lot of projects in mind in an original-artistic-minded way. She told me that she also had a lot of ideas that she would like to make reality. So we decided to join our forces to begin creating new original projects together.

Later that day I asked her If she would be interested in programming a Kamasutra for the iPhone (later when I read that the iPad was coming we decided to concentrate all our energy to port it to that device). She immediately answered positively because she always liked the Indian Culture. I also told her that the reason of creating a Kamasutra for the iPhone is because some years ago, when I had my Palm 501, the application that I most liked (and that other people always downloaded in these first PDA-Days) was the Palmsutra. I always said in these days that when I had free time and when I would have finished my studies I would like to port the Palmsutra for other devices.

So the following day we started to search new information about the Kamasutra and thought about how we could be different to all the others, because right now a lot of Kamasutras where out there in the iTunes Store. We decided that we would create a minimalistic open minded Kamasutra without using the forbidden words !

In the same afternoon we decided the name Pica Creations. That is because if you put together the first characters of our names it gives you PICA.
