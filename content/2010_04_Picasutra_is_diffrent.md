The reason why we programmed Picasutra is because we have seen in the market a lot of Kamasutra Apps but all fail in one thing: They do not encourage your imagination. All the Kamasutra's that we found do the same thing: They show you a explicit image with a objective text description.

We want to inspire your imagination, we want that you feel free when having fun with you partner. We don't want to give you a manual with all the positions, we only want to give you a brief introduction. We think that you are responsible to use your imagination, and that's why our images and our text descriptions lets all open-minded.

In the near future, if our first version of the Kamasutra is successful then we have some nice surprises for you, free downloadable for our first customers.
